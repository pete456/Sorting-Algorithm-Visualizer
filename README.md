* Sorting Algorithm Visualization
A basic descending insertion sort aglorithm that is visualized using SDL. An integer list is parsed and the values are stored in a custom struct, also containing a texture, and a SDL_Rect. I compare two values next to each other in the custom struct array, and if the value at a lower index are greater, the custom structs x pos are swapped, then their positions in the array are swapped.
